# Primo - Adaptive Discovery

## _Documentation of Features & Customization_

The CSCU library consortium uses Ex Libris Alma/Primo as their discovery system. The user interface can be customized to support and improve the user experience. 
The following is a documentation of the customizations made by our colleagues across the CSCU libraries. It is follow-up of two projects undertaken by the Primo/Discovery Expert Team:

- a multi-campus UX study and resulting recommendations
- a survey & inventory of changes made by each institution

The purpose of this documentation is to share knowledge and experience, so that anyone can customize their Primo instance for better discovery.
